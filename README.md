## 🤖🔗 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using OpenAI & Ollama 🚀
Welcome to an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining the power of OpenAI models and Ollama! ⚙️ This project enhances LLM responses with real-time data retrieval, enabling smarter, context-rich answers.

## 💡 What is this?
A smart system that:

🔍 Retrieves relevant data from custom sources.
🧠 Combines it with OpenAI or Ollama's local LLMs to generate intelligent answers.
🗂️ Handles both online (API) and offline (local) LLM setups.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍 (Core backend).
LangChain 🦜🔗 (RAG pipeline management).
OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 API 🤯.
Ollama (Llama2, Mistral, etc.) 🦙 (Local LLMs).
PostgreSQL 🐘 (Storing embeddings & data).
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎨 (Interactive frontend).

## ✨ Key Features
🔗 Combines OpenAI API & Ollama Local Models for flexible RAG.
🧠 Advanced AI-generated responses backed by real data.
📄 Support for PDF, CSV, and other data loaders.
⚡ Fast, real-time RAG processing.
🖥️ Simple, elegant user interface (HTML, CSS, JS).

## 📂 Setup and Run

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/srus1608/RAG_using_openai_ollama.git
cd RAG_using_openai_ollama

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
